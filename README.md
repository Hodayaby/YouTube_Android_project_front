# Challenges and Teamwork:
During the development process, we encountered various challenges:
We faced challenges with different and busy schedules, which required us to carefully coordinate our work.
Understanding the new Android development environment was another significant hurdle, especially when it came to saving videos.
We needed to deeply understand how to handle permissions and convert between different formats. 
Additionally, organizing and maintaining order in our project was essential.
Effective teamwork and regular communication helped us overcome these obstacles and keep the project on track.
